# Descent: Into Darkness
 
Descent is an experimental procedural cave generation system made for Minecraft 1.14 - 1.16. Descent generates caves using a shape grammar system optimized for generating "interesting" caves for maximum replayability. Inspired by Deep Rock Galactic's cave generation as well as Path of Exile's philosophy on maximizing replayability with limited assets.

Descent is inteded for use as an instanced system. Cave systems are generated individually, and do not care if they intersect.

*Descent is an experimental concept plugin for CivEx: reddit.com/r/civex *

The vision behind Descent is to provide players with a new, engaging mining experience. Instead of grinding aimlessly, Descent allows you to create instanced subterranean "dungeon runs," which become more challenging the deeper players explore and the longer they stay.

Descent is intended to have a survival atmosphere. Caves are not filled with enemies as in a traditional dungeon. Most of the time, players will traverse quiet caves with the occasional trickle of mobs. If players are greedy enough, a sudden, loud screech will signal swarm of mobs will pouring in through the darkness ahead of them.

A hidden risk score tracks how cautious players are, and determines when to ramp up the difficulty.
